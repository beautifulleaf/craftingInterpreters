# craftingInterpreters
My implementation of Crafting Interpreters. Work in progress.

To-do list
- Overhaul error reporting. 
- Allow methods on numbers (123.sqrt).
- See if error reporting for syntax errors needs to be made more specific.
- Add support for comma expressions. 
- Add support for the conditional operator. 
- Add error productions to handle each binary operator appearing w/o a left-hand operand.
